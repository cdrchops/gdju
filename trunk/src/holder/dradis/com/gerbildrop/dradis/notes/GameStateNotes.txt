GameStates should be singletons.
   handling all aspects of the game regarding that state
   each state currently performs as expected, however, if you are using multiple game states
        then the game states are reloaded each time, and if you do this too many times then the
        game will crash b/c the game state is kept in memory, however, a new instance is created
        when the action is called... therefore, this is a memory leak

    issues: when making a gamestate a singleton, the gamestate may not update correctly if you use some
            of the same items in that game state... e.g. my clock and my timer instances
