LoadingGameState
    currently, the loading game state works ok.  It is not a singleton, however, it also doesn't have
    all of the parameters that it could for setting various loading screens

    the design should be modified for a different game state for each of the set functionality that is needed
    e.g. a text and non graphic loading bar
         bg image
         multiple bg images
         Hud like loader with border and overlay
         stretching image
         sliding image
         clipped image (meaning we cut off part of the image so that it doesn't display while loading)
