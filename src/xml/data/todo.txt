SAX and DOM support?

Admin page to display all properties for the beans
AND show/hide them

1) properties can not begin with _ unless the getter and setter also have a _
    e.g. _id must be matched with
         get_Id();
         set_Id(SETTER_OBJECT SETTER_VALUE);

2)

does it work with attributes that are not the classname?
