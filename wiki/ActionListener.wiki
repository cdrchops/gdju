= ActionListeners =

To create an ActionListener you can:
  * implement the ActionListener class in a subclass
  * or you can create an Anonymous class

Anonymous class

{{{
private ActionListener listener = new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
        handleInput(event);
    }
};
}}}

If you create an Anonymous [ActionListener] like this you'll have to define the _handleInput(ActionEvent)_ method in your class.

{{{
public void handleInput(ActionEvent event) {
    //this is where you'll handle stuff
}
}}}

So, what can we do with the [ActionEvent] when it's been fired off by the _BComponent_
