= ActionEvent =

[ActionEvent] is the event fired off by a _BComponent_ to the listeners of your _BComponent_

To find out what *action* was fired off you can simply ask the [ActionEvent]

{{{
String action = event.getAction();
}}}

From the example above it's clear that _getAction()_ returns a _String_.  From there you check the //String// against known actions you want performed.

e.g.
{{{
if (action.equals("back")) {
    //we're going to go back
}
}}}

What about filtering by a specific _BComponent_ type?  For example, you only want to work with an event that is from a _BButton_.

{{{
Object source = event.getSource();
if (source instanceof BButton) {
    //now perform an action
}
}}}

What if you want to process one event from your _BComponent_ then pass the rest of the processing on to another listener?

{{{
event.dispatch(listener); // where listener is a defined listener in your class or another class that has a local instance in this class
}}}
